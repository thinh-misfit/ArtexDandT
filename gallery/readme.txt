WHAT IS SINGLE FILE PHP GALLERY?

Single File PHP Gallery is a web gallery in one single file. All you have to do is copy the script to any directory containing images to make a gallery. Sub directories will be sub galleries. Thumbnails for images and directories are generated automatically. Descriptions for galleries and images can be added by making a simple text file.
Single File PHP Gallery does not require any configuration or programming skills to use.

You can see how it looks in the on-line demo here:

  http://sye.dk/sfpg/

IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THIS VERSION

* Added automatic clean-up function to have the gallery delete unused files in DATA_ROOT.
	The gallery will now clean up files in the DATA_ROOT that are no longer used by the gallery. So make sure not to use the DATA_ROOT for storing anything.
	The clean up routine is activated when viewing a directory where the number of subdirectories, images and/or files have changed since last access to the directory.
	For this to work, PHP needs permission to delete files in the DATA_ROOT.

* Changed the DATA_ROOT information file names, so upgrading to this version will require the contents of the DATA_ROOT to be deleted, so the gallery can build the new files.
	The information files in DATA_ROOT/info/ was previously named with a .sfpg extension. This extension is no longer added.
	This change is made to simplify and performance optimize the script.

* Added option to delete images older than a set number of days. If using this option, make sure to have a backup of all your images in the GALLERY_ROOT.

____________________________________________________________
REQUIREMENTS

For this gallery to function you will need the following:
 * A web server capable of running PHP 5 scripts
 * The PHP GD library (php_gd) installed. See here for information: http://php.net/gd
 * PHP write access to server
 * PHP memory limit large enough to contain both full size image and preview/thumb (converted to BMP) See the FAQ section for further information on this.


____________________________________________________________
HOW TO USE / QUICK START

The only thing you have to do is place a copy of the index.php file to any directory of your web.
When this is done all images (jpg, jpeg, png, gif) and files if enabled, in that directory and all sub directories will be shown in the gallery.

By default the script will try to create a folder called "_sfpg_data" in which thumbnails, previews and information is saved. This can be changed using the DATA_ROOT constant. If PHP only have write access in a certain folder, change the DATA_ROOT to point there.


____________________________________________________________
TIPS / FAQ

 * If some or all thumbnails is missing or show up as a red X, the reason could be that the full images is too big for the php-engine to load them into memory. You will then have to do one of the following:
     1. Make the full images smaller
     2. Increase the memory_limit in php.ini. (If the memory_limit is 8MB, it gives a maximum image size on about 1600*1600)

 * If no thumbnails or images show, it could be that the script does not have the php tag "<?php" as the very first. The php tag must come before any other output. A blank line above or even a space before the tag will render the script useless. This can also happen if the auto_prepend_file option in php is used.

 * Single File PHP Gallery does not have to be called index.php, you can rename it to whatever you like.


____________________________________________________________
SUPPORT / REQUESTS / HELP / CONTACT

If you need help getting Single File PHP Gallery to work, then please start by running the SFPG TEST script file on the server. The SFPG TEST script is a normal PHP page, and you can download it from the Single File PHP Gallery page. The script tests to see if the requirements for the script to run are met, and generates an output explaining what could be the issue. If the output from the script does not provide enough information for you to make the script work, then please use the contact form on the Single File PHP Gallery page. Describe the issue you are having and also copy/paste the information from the SFPG TEST script along with the description.

If you have comments, questions, requests, greetings etc. regarding Single File PHP Gallery, please use the contact form on my page.

____________________________________________________________
KNOWN ISSUES

 * Vertical scrollbar is missing when viewing a directory containing more thumbnails than window can show at one time. This issue have been seen on Apple iOS(iPad, iPhone..), Android devices and Opera browsers. On most hand held devices you can still scroll using normal one finger, or two finger swipe.
 * If a thumbnail for a given image exists, it will be used. So remember to delete old thumbnails if you make changes to the way thumbnails are created. If, for an example, you change the size of thumbnails, you will need to delete the old ones already saved, in order to have the changes apply, and have new thumbnails created. This is by design, and will not be fixed.
 * First access to a gallery containing many images or directories, will take a long time to load, because the script have to create thumbnails for all the images. If the script timeout, the rest of the folders will be left without thumbnails and information. Then just refresh the page and the script will continue from where it came. The folder where the script stopped might not have a thumbnail. If this is so just click the gallery, and the thumb will be created. This is by design, and will not be fixed.
 * File-preview images are not used for gallery thumbnails. I recommend using a dir image (DIR_IMAGE_FILE). This is by design, and will not be fixed.
 * Images smaller than preview size will still have preview size images created, and will also have the option to load full-size, even though they is the same size.
 * Single File PHP Gallery version 4.x is a stand-alone gallery. It is not designed to be included on existing pages. This is by design, and will not be fixed.


____________________________________________________________
CONFIGURATION INFORMATION

The script can be edited in a plain text editor. Open the index.php and you will find the configuration section at the top of the script.

Refer to the descriptions below for configuration.


____________________________________________________________
define('GALLERY_ROOT', './');

Set the path of the gallery root, where the images and sub directories containing images is placed.
The default value is './' which is the directory where the script is placed.
If SHOW_FILES is TRUE, the files will only be downloadable if a relative path like the one in example 1 is used.

GALLERY_ROOT should always end with a slash like the examples below.

Example 1: './images/'
Example 2: $_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT].'/gallery/images/'
Example 3: '/users/bob_the_user/wwwroot/images/my_pictures/'


____________________________________________________________
define('DATA_ROOT', './_sfpg_data/');

Set the path to where thumbnails and other data should be saved. PHP needs to have write access to this directory. If PHP only have write access in a certain directory, change the DATA_ROOT to point there.

By default DATA_ROOT points to a directory called _sfpg_data in the same directory where the script is placed. If the directory do not exists, the script will try to create it. The _sfpg_data directory is by default excluded from the gallery, using the $dir_exclude option.

DATA_ROOT should always end with a slash like the examples below.

Example 1: './thumbs/'
Example 2: $_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT].'/gallery/thumbs/'
Example 3: '/users/bob_the_user/data/sfpg_thumbs/'


____________________________________________________________
define('SECURITY_PHRASE', 'change this text!');

Set this option to a random phrase or a number of random chars, and don't tell anyone! The string will be used to make the gallery URL's tamper resistant to avoid creative or malicious use.

Data stored in the DATA_ROOT uses this phrase. So if this option is changed, the contents of DATA_ROOT directory should be deleted. It will then regenerate automatically.

Example 1: 'hTfw9nTr4d'
Example 2: 'Maerc.Eci,Ekil-i'


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_NAME_FILE', '_name.txt');

Set the name of the file that can be placed in every directory of the gallery.
If a file with the given name is found, the first line of text from the file will be used instead of the directory name. Directories will still be sorted after the actual name.

IMPORTANT: The file name in this setting must end with the extension in DESC_EXT. Dafault value for DESC_EXT is '.txt'.

TIP 1: This is useful if you would like to use chars that cannot be used in directory names.
TIP 2: See SORT_DIVIDER for an easy way of sorting directories, images and files.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_IMAGE_FILE', '_image.jpg');

Set the name of the image that can be placed in every directory in the gallery.
If an image with the given name is found, it will be used as thumbnail for that directory. The image will not be displayed inside the directory.

You can also place an image with the given name in the ICONS_DIR, to have it used as thumb on all directories that do not have images inside.

TIP 1: This is very useful when having directories with only files of non-supported image types for download.
TIP 2: You do not have to resize the image, it will be resized like all other images in the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_DESC_FILE', '_desc.txt');

Set the name of the description file that can be placed in every directory of the gallery (including the GALLERY_ROOT).
If a file with the given name is found, the text will be shown in the gallery. The text can include HTML tags.

IMPORTANT: The file name in this setting must end with the extension in DESC_EXT. Dafault value for DESC_EXT is '.txt'.

____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_DESC_IN_GALLERY', TRUE);

Set to TRUE to have description shown in the gallery using with the thumbnails.
Set to FALSE to not show description in the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_DESC_IN_INFO', TRUE);

Set to TRUE to have description shown in the information box.
Set to FALSE to not have description shown in the information box.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_SORT_REVERSE', FALSE);

Set to TRUE to sort directories in reverse order (highest to lowest).
Set to FALSE to sort directories in normal order (lowest to highest).

See also DIR_SORT_BY_TIME and SORT_NATURAL for other sorting options for dirs.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_SORT_BY_TIME', FALSE);

Set to TRUE to sort directories by modified time.
Set to FALSE to sort directories by name.

The modified time of a directory is normally updated when changes is made to the contents of the given directory. Even deleting a file or image can make the directory "new". (This might differ from platform to platform).

See also DIR_SORT_REVERSE and SORT_NATURAL for other sorting options for dirs.


____________________________________________________________
$dir_exclude = array('_sfpg_data', '_sfpg_icons');

Set an array of directory names that should not be shown in the gallery.

Directory names should be entered in lower case.
Exclusion is not case sensitive. If you exclude 'oldimages', all the following directories will all be excluded: 'OldImages', 'oldImages', 'OLDIMAGES' and so on.

Example 1: array('cgi-bin');
Example 2: array('cgi-bin', 'include', 'old_images');

See also $file_exclude and $file_ext_exclude for other ways of excluding elements from the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
define('DIR_EXCLUDE_REGEX', '');

Use regular expressions to exclude directories from gallery view.
See here for syntax: http://php.net/manual/en/pcre.pattern.php

____________________________________________________________
define('ROTATE_IMAGES', TRUE);

Set to TRUE to have images rotated according to the orientation information in EXIF.
Set to FALSE to not rotate images.

Rotated images are saved on the server in the DATA_ROOT. This could take up a lot of disk space.
If images have been saved on server you will have to delete them in order to have changes to this setting apply.
Rotating images will require twice the amount of RAM, than that for generating thumbs.


____________________________________________________________
define('IMAGE_JPEG_QUALITY', 90);

Set the quality for jpeg images. Range from 0 (worst quality and smallest file size) to 100 (best quality and largest file size).
If images have been saved on server you will have to delete them in order to have changes to this setting apply.
This setting is used for full size and preview images. These are saved on server after being rotated or watermarks have been added.

Set to TRUE to show file name extensions.
Set to FALSE to not show file name extensions.


____________________________________________________________
define('FILE_IN_NEW_WINDOW', TRUE);

Set to TRUE to have files open in a pop-up window.
Set to FALSE to have files open in the same window.


____________________________________________________________
define('FILE_THUMB_EXT', '.jpg');

Set the extension of file thumbnail files. Place an image with the same name as a file with the set extension added to the file name, to have the image used as a thumbnail for the file. The image will be resized like any other thumbnail in the gallery.

INFO 1: Can be set to any of the supported image types.
INFO 2: Case sensitivity in this constant follows the case sensitivity of the server on which the script runs.
INFO 3: Extensions should be entered with a dot in front, like the example below.

Example: If set to '.jpg' and one of the files is named 'In_The_Snow.avi'. You can then make an image called 'In_The_Snow.avi.jpg', and place it in the same folder as the image.


____________________________________________________________
define('FILE_SORT_REVERSE', FALSE);

Set to TRUE to sort files in reverse order (highest to lowest).

$file_exclude = array();

Set an array of file names that should not be shown in the gallery.

INFO 1: File names should be entered in lower case.
INFO 2: Exclusions works only on non-supported file types.
INFO 3: Exclusion is not case sensitive. If you exclude "readme.txt", all the following files will be excluded: "readme.txt", "ReadMe.Txt","README.TXT" and so on.

Example 1: array("readme.txt");
Example 2: array("readme.txt", "admin.php", "style.css");

See also $file_ext_exclude and $dir_exclude for other ways of excluding elements from the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
$file_ext_exclude = array('.php', '.txt', '.sell');

Set an array of file extensions for files that should not be shown in the gallery.

INFO 1: Extensions should be entered in low case with a dot in front, like the examples below.
INFO 2: Exclusions works only on non-supported file types. You cannot exclude the supported image types.
INFO 3: Exclusion is not case sensitive. If you exclude ".txt", all files with the following extensions will be excluded: ".txt", ".Txt", ".TXT" and so on.

The default exclusions are there because:
'.php' to not show the gallery it self, or other php files.
'.txt' to not show text files, as they by default are used for description.
'.sell' to not show the PayPal sell files. See PayPal options for more information on that.

Example 1: array(".php");
Example 2: array(".php", ".txt", ".inc", ".html");

Also see $file_exclude, FILE_EXCLUDE_REGEX, $dir_exclude and DIR_EXCLUDE_REGEX for other ways of excluding elements from the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
define('FILE_EXCLUDE_REGEX', '');

Use regular expressions to exclude files from gallery view.
See here for syntax: http://php.net/manual/en/pcre.pattern.php


____________________________________________________________
$file_ext_thumbs = array();

Set an array to associate extensions with images for them to be used as thumbnails for non-image files.
To use this option you must:
 1. Create a directory named as set in the ICONS_DIR option. By default it is called "_sfpg_icons" and placed in the GALLERY_ROOT.
 2. Place the images that are to be used as thumbnails in the directory.
 3. Associate the images with extensions using the $file_ext_thumbs array.

INFO: Extensions should be entered in lower case with a dot in front, like the examples below.

Example 1: array('.pdf' => 'pdf.png');
Example 2: array('.pdf' => 'pdf.png', '.zip' => 'zip.png');

In example 1, an image called "pdf.png" have been created and placed in the ICONS_DIR directory.
This will make all PDF files have the given image as thumbnail.

TIP: You do not have to resize the images in the ICON directory, they will be resized to fit the thumb box, like all other images in the gallery.


____________________________________________________________
define('ICONS_DIR', '_sfpg_icons/');

Set the name of the directory where images to be used as thumbs for file types can be placed. If changed remember to also change the $dir_exclude option to not show it inside the gallery.
The directory must be placed inside the GALLERY_ROOT. The directory needs to end with a slash, like the default one: '_sfpg_icons/'.

INFO: This option is optional. If not used, the directory does not need to exist.


____________________________________________________________
define('LINK_BACK', '');

Set a URL to show a button that will function as a link to the set URL. This can be used as a "Back to my site" button.
Set to '' to not show the button.

Example 1: Set to '/' to have button take you to the root of your web.
Example 2: Set to 'http://www.yoursite.com/page.html'.

See TEXT_LINK_BACK for the text on the button.


____________________________________________________________
define('CHARSET', 'iso-8859-1');

Set the charset to be used. In order to have special chars display correctly, a charset that support the chars used in the gallery, must be set.

Below is a short list of charsets that can be used (use a search engine on the Internet for others):

Universal Alphabet:        'utf-8'
Western Alphabet:          'iso-8859-1'
Central European Alphabet: 'iso-8859-2'
Latin 3 Alphabet:          'iso-8859-3'
Baltic Alphabet:           'iso-8859-4'
Cyrillic Alphabet:         'iso-8859-5'
Arabic Alphabet:           'iso-8859-6'
Greek Alphabet:            'iso-8859-7'
Hebrew Alphabet:           'iso-8859-8'
Japanese:                  'shift-jis'

____________________________________________________________
define('DATE_FORMAT', 'Y-m-d h:i:s');

Set the format of the date/time to be shown after the TEXT_DATE.
See a PHP manual or the following page for information on the date format: http://php.net/date


____________________________________________________________
define('DESC_EXT', '.txt');

Set the extension of the description files. Place a file with the same name as an image or file with the set extension added to the image name, to have the text shown with the image or file.

Case sensitivity in this constant follows the case sensitivity of the server on which the script runs.
Extensions should be entered with a dot in front, like the example below.

Example: If set to '.txt' and one of the images is named
         "IMG_10a.jpg". You can then make a file called
         "IMG_10a.jpg.txt", and place it in the same folder as the image.

If SHOW_FILES is set to TRUE you can use $file_ext_exclude to exclude the description files from the view. So if you would like to list .txt but don't want the descriptions files shown, you should set to any other extension that you do not use (feel free to use ".sfpg") and exclude that one using $file_ext_exclude.
	 

____________________________________________________________
define('SORT_DIVIDER', '--');

Set the string that will function as a divider between the part of the name to sort after and the name to be shown.
SORT_DIVIDER works on directories, images and files.

Example: If you have a directory called "Apples" and one called "Bananas", and would like "Bananas" to be the first one on the list. You could then call them: "001--Bananas" and "002--Apples". The directories will then be listed in the order you like, and only the text after the SORT_DIVIDER string will be shown.


____________________________________________________________
define('SORT_NATURAL', TRUE);

Set to TRUE to have directories, images and files sorted in a case insensitive "natural order".
Set to FALSE to have elements sorted normally.

Set to TRUE to have the script extract and show EXIF information like Camera Model, Shutter Speed and Focal Length.
Set to FALSE to not extract and show EXIF information.

INFO: The extraction of information is done when the thumbnail is generated. So changing from FALSE to TRUE requires you to delete the contents of the DATA_ROOT, to have new thumbnails generated.


____________________________________________________________
define('SHOW_IPTC_INFO', TRUE);

Set to TRUE to have the script extract and show IPTC information like Category, Title and Copyright.
Set to FALSE to not extract and show IPTC information.

define('USE_PREVIEW', FALSE);

Set to TRUE to have the script generate intermediate preview images. The preview images will be shown when a thumbnail is clicked, and a "Full resolution" button will be enabled to allow switching between full resolution and preview.
The preview images are generated when accessed for the first time, and will be saved on the server for later usage.
Set to FALSE to not use intermediate preview images.
This option is useful if the gallery contains large images that will take long time to load.


____________________________________________________________
define('PREVIEW_MAX_WIDTH', 600);

Set the maximum number of pixels a preview image width may be.
If preview images have been saved on server you will have to delete them in order to have changes to this setting apply.


____________________________________________________________
define('PREVIEW_MAX_HEIGHT', 400);

Set the maximum number of pixels a preview image height may be.
If preview images have been saved on server you will have to delete them in order to have changes to this setting apply.


____________________________________________________________
define('PREVIEW_ENLARGE', FALSE);

Set to TRUE to have preview images for images that are smaller than PREVIEW_MAX_WIDTH and PREVIEW_MAX_HEIGHT enlarged.
Set to FALSE to have preview images for images that are smaller than PREVIEW_MAX_WIDTH and PREVIEW_MAX_HEIGHT stay the size they are.


____________________________________________________________
define('PREVIEW_JPEG_QUALITY', 75);

Set the quality for jpeg preview images. Range from 0 (worst quality and smallest file size) to 100 (best quality and largest file size).
If preview images have been saved on server you will have to delete them in order to have changes to this setting apply.


____________________________________________________________
define('WATERMARK', '');

Set the filename of the image that is to be used as watermark on all images in gallery.
This will make all images, preview images and thumbnails contain the watermark in the lower right corner of the image.

To use this option you must:
 1. Create a directory named like set in the ICONS_DIR option (by default named "_sfpg_icons" and placed in the GALLERY_ROOT).
 2. Place the image that is to be used as watermark in the directory.
 3. Add the name of the image to the WATERMARK constant.

Example: define('WATERMARK', 'watermark.png');

In the example above, an image called "watermark.png" have been created and placed in the "_sfpg_icons" directory in the GALLERY_ROOT.

INFO 1: If set, all images containing watermark will be cached in the DATA_ROOT.
INFO 2: If set or changed after images, thumbnails or preview images have been created, then all thumbnails need to be deleted from the DATA_ROOT in order to have new images including watermark created.
INFO 3: Case sensitivity in this constant follows the case sensitivity of the server on which the script runs.
INFO 4: Depending on the set IMAGE_JPEG_QUALITY, this could take up the same or more space than the original images in GALLERY_ROOT.
INFO 5: Generating the full size image with watermark will require about twice the memory than when generating the thumb.

The watermark image will not be resized. It will be be applied in the original size.


____________________________________________________________
define('WATERMARK_FRACTION', 0.1);

Set the fraction for how large the watermark should be compared to the full image. When setting the watermark size, the shortest side of the full image is used.
Set to FALSE to always have the watermark applied as is, in its actual size.

The default value 0.1 is 10%. With this setting and with a full size image that is 1600*1200 pixels, the watermark will set to have a height of 120 pixels (the width is scaled to maintain the aspect ratio).


____________________________________________________________
define('LOW_IMAGE_RESAMPLE_QUALITY', FALSE);

Set to TRUE to have the script use a less CPU demanding function to generate thumbnails
Set to FALSE to use a high will make thumbs and preview images generate much faster, with less CPU usage on server, but will make them grainy looking.


____________________________________________________________
define('KEYBOARD_NAVIGATION', TRUE);

Set to TRUE to enable gallery navigation using the keyboard.
Set to FALSE to not enable gallery navigation using the keyboard.

Change to the next picture: Arrow Down, Arrow Right, Page Down, Space
Change to the previous picture: Arrow Up, Arrow Left, Page Up
While showing an image ESC can be used to close image view. While viewing thumbs ESC can be used to go one directory up/out.


____________________________________________________________
define('INFO_BOX_WIDTH', 250);

____________________________________________________________
define('THUMB_BOX_EXTRA_HEIGHT', 14);

Set the number of pixels that will be added to the thumbnail boxes height. This would normally be a little larger than the set font size. So if the font size is increased, this probably also needs to be increased.
If THUMB_CHARS_MAX is set to 0, to not show thumbnail names, this should also be set to 0.


____________________________________________________________
define('THUMB_CHARS_MAX', 20);

Set the maximum number of chars that will be printed below thumbnails.
Set to 0 to not show thumbnail names. If set to 0 THUMB_BOX_EXTRA_HEIGHT should also be set to 0.

The gallery will only change to the next image when both the time have gone, and the next image are fully loaded. So if the images are large and/or the client connection slow, then images may be displayed longer than the set value.
To disable the slideshow option, simply remove the text from the TEXT_SLIDESHOW option.


____________________________________________________________
define('PAYPAL_ENABLED', FALSE);

Set to TRUE to enable selling items in the gallery using PayPal.
Set to FALSE to disable PayPal selling.

Using the PayPal option requires write access to the GALLERY_ROOT, for updating the "in stock" count when items are being sold.

Using the PayPal option:
If you have an item you want to sell, you first need to have an image of it, as only images can have a price. Files and folders in the gallery can't be sold.
Lets say you have an image called 'My first painting.jpg'. You then have to make a sell file, which is a text file with the same name as the image with the PAYPAL_EXTENSION added.
By default the PAYPAL_EXTENSION is '.sell'. Making it look like this:

My first painting.jpg
My first painting.jpg.sell

In the 'My first painting.jpg.sell' file there should be two or three lines, like this:

------ FILE CONTENT STARTS BELOW THIS LINE ------
19.95
1
Paint001
------ FILE CONTENT ENDS ABOVE THIS LINE ------

The first line '19.95' is the price for the item.
The second line '1' is the amount you have for sale. In this example there are only one for sale.
The third line is optional. In this example 'Paint001' is a unique identifier you can use to keep track of your inventory. It will be written in the information from PayPal when a sell is completed. If the third line is omitted the path and image name is put in its place. Just keep in mind that the path and image together, may not be longer than 127 chars(a limit set by PayPal).

The price, amount and unique item identifier will be shown in the information box when you hover the mouse over the thumb, and also when the image is shown in full.
If the second line in the sell file is larger than 0, the 'Buy this item' button (also shown in information box) will be active. If the number is 0 the 'Buy this item' button will be disabled (Sold out).

When a user clicks the 'Buy this item' button, then first the sell file is checked to see if the item is still available, then a unique file is generated in the DATA_ROOT/buy/ and finally the user will be redirected to PayPal.
If the user completes the PayPal payment, the user is then sent back to the gallery using a special link, which is then matched with the unique file in DATA_ROOT, which is then used to decreases the amount in the sell file by one.
If the user cancels the buy, they will be sent back to the item in the gallery, and the amount is untouched. Every time a user clicks 'Buy this item', unused unique files in DATA_ROOT/buy/ older than one week, are removed.

You should however always check the status of the amount you have for sale when an item have been sold, as the user buying the item might not end the buy by returning to your site, and so the amount is not decreased. If this is the case, you will then have to decrease the amount by one yourself.
